            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Samuel Rumbley, a senior at Tennessee Technological University majoring in Business Information and Technology. I am passionate about data analysis, cybersecurity, and technology trends.</p>
            <p>During my time in college, I have been serving as a Substitute Teacher for Wilson and Putnam County Schools. In these roles, I utilize critical thinking and leadership skills to create a safe and effective learning environment. My passion for education extends beyond the classroom, as demonstrated by my involvement in the Scouting program, where I empower scouts to achieve their life goals. My dedication to scouting has provided me with opportunities to build volunteer networks and develop youth leadership skills.</p>
            <p>I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Business Information and Technology at Tennessee Technological University. My goal is to combine my experience in education with my technical expertise to make a meaningful impact in various fields. I believe that a well-rounded education will equip me to contribute to a rapidly evolving world.</p>
            <p>I'm actively seeking internship or co-op opportunities to gain practical experience and explore potential career paths. Specifically, I'm interested in data analysis, cybersecurity, event planning, and exploring current trends in technology.</p>
